Module 8 Submission Work

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

      Brief summary regarding this piece of what was to develop a design template for a client, The Gaming Room. Based on the Draw It or Lose It game of the 80's, they had originally developed an Andriod app similar nature, however, they are wanting to expand it into a web-based version to be used across multiple platforms.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

      For me, the UML Diagram was maybe the least complex, however, it was the most enjoyable part and an area when developing code or a program makes a lot of sense to me. Understanding what the client wants on a road-map list picture is sometimes easier than the sometimes heavy verbage of a client's needs and wants. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
      
      How the project was present in a step by step way made the development of the program easier than say having a generalized idea prior, trying to understand a piece-milled plan, and then developing something from that. It's the fundational planning and considerations that have been quite helpful throughout the project as well. 
      
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

      I would most likely change the Evaluation table into a narrative format to allow for a more detail explanation of each piece rather than a bullet style way of highlighting the best or worst features of platform. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

      Understanding we were designing software for a game versus some other kind of product. Being able to highlight how programming using a specific language or using one platform as a template would be better in the long run than using another. As well it's also to help a client understand, while thing might have a vested interest in a particular platform or way of doing something, it may not be in their best interest to go a specific direction.
      
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

      A lot of it is looking at the details and understanding the project of what is being created. Those details are the potential differences in what should be created and the ultimate outcome of what we understood and how that understanding became a product.
